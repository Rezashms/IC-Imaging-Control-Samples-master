# Polarization Camera Demo

This demo project shows how to use the The Imaging Source polarization cameras
 * DYK 33UX250
 * DYK 33GX250 
 * DZK 33UX250
 * DZK 33GX250

The project contains two demos:
<dl>
  <dt><strong>DoLP Segmentation</strong></dt>
  <dd>This sample shows, how to visualize the degree of polarized light.</dd>
  <dt><strong>Visualization Modes</strong></dt>
  <dd>This demo shows, how to set he visualization modes programmatically </dd>
</dl>

The project "LibPolarizationCamera" contains an IC Imaging Control FrameFilter, that performs the image processing on the ADC1 and ACI1 pixel formats.

The USB Polarization cameras needs a driver version 4.7 or higher. The GigE camera needs a driver version 3.6.0 or higher.
